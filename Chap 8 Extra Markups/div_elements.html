                The artificial Intelligence program of the 
                PIAIC takes the student through the foundation 
                of AI technology via teaching programing in a 
                open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, 
                Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and taeching deploying 
                practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending 
                with real-life examples of medern day AI in practice.

            <h1>Cloud Native Computing</h1>
            <p id="cnc">
                The Cloud Native Computingprogram prepares the student to program in open source technologies like LInux, Doker,
                Kubernates, JavaScipt, Node.JS, and React Native while introducing student to development of Microservices and
                softwere development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.

            <h1>Blockchain Computing</h1>
            <p id="bcc">
                The main emphasis of blockchain program is to understand blockchain like Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)
                and learn to prograam in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frame work like Node.JS. The program also 
                introduces them to development of Distributrd Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth 
                understanding of <Blockchain-as-a-Service>(BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICF) 
                of a crypto-token.

            <p id="iot">
                The internet of thing introduces the student to open source development technologies like Rust, Embaded, 
                Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistance, and Kubernates while making them efficient in developing
                Microservices for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device computing.
